        "1. Split the string into two halves.\n",
        "2. Reverse the second half.\n",
        "3. Compare the first half to the reversed second half.\n",

        "For example, the first half of the string \"noon\" is \"no\" and the second half is \"on\". The reverse of the second half is \"no\". Since the first half is equal to the reverse of the second half, \"noon\" is a palindrome.\n",

        "For a string with an odd length, let's consider \"racecar\". When splitting the string into two halves, we omit the middle character, \"e\". The first half of the string is \"rac\" and the second half of the string is \"car\". The reverse of the second half is \"rac\". Since the first half is equal to the reverse of the second half, \"racecar\" is a palindrome.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, for a string that is not a palindrome, let's consider \"dented\". The first half of the string is \"den\" and the second half of the string is \"ted\". The reverse of the second half is \"det\". Since the first half is not equal to the reverse of the second half, \"dented\" is not a palindrome."
